# Quantum RNNs

This research track is about our investigation on Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN), improving on well-known classical machine learning techniques like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) using the power of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) to create quantum counterparts QLSTM and QGRU.

We have done a couple of use cases for it so far:

QLSTM for asset price prediction: https://github.com/DikshantDulal/SoftServe_QLSTM
QGRU for quantum drug generator: https://gitlab.com/damyr_hadiiev/quantum-drug-generator/-/tree/main/ReLeaSE-multiobjective
We have found a couple of academic papers that would be useful:

The power of quantum neural networks by Abbas et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00027.pdf
Effective dimension of machine learning models by Abbas et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04807.pdf
