    "Stock price prediction is one of the most rewarding problems in modern finance, where the accurate forecasting of future stock prices can yield significant profit and reduce the risks. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent Neural Network (RNN) applicable to a broad range of problems aiming to analyze or classify sequential data. Therefore, many people have used LSTM to predict the future stock price based on the historical data sequences with great success.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, recent studies have shown that the LSTM's efficiency and trainability can be improved by replacing some of the layers in the LSTM with variational quantum layers, thus making it a quantum-classical hybrid model of LSTM which we will call QLSTM for Quantum LSTM. In the study done by Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Shinjae Yoo, and Yao-Lung L. Fang, they show that QLSTM offers better trainability compared to its classical counterpart as it proved to learn significantly more information after the first training epoch than its classical counterpart, learnt the local features better, all while having a comparable number of parameters. Inspired by these recent results, we proceed to test this variational quantum-classical hybrid neural network technique on stock price predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook, we show a proof of concept that QLSTM can be used to great effect for stock price prediction, offering comparable and arguably better results than its classical counterpart. To do so, we implement both LSTM and QLSTM to predict the stock prices of the company Merck & Co. Inc (MRK) with the same number of features, of which we chose based on earlier studies done with stock price predictions."

    "Given that we would want to eventually use the QLSTM on real quantum computers, it would be prudent to discuss its viability in terms of the number of gates and qubits used. First of all, we look at the number of qubits. As can be seen, in a barebones early version of QLSTM, we can afford to use any number of qubits, even a small number like 4 to run it. This is because we can sandwich it between two classical layers, where the classical layers help to convert the vector sizes to the correct amount, from the embedding of input features into the quantum circuit to the processing of the output measurements. This is very similar in idea to dressed quantum circuits, which was presented in:\n",

    "Transfer learning in hybrid classical-quantum neural networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08278, Andrea Mari, Thomas R. Bromley, Josh Izaac, Maria Schuld, Nathan Killoran\n",
    "\n",
    "In the foreseeable future in the NISQ era, we would likely be continuing to use the same technique, although the number of qubits can be increased to improve the model, making this technique useful in the NISQ era.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the number of gates used per circuit, we take a look at how the overall depth would increase as number of qubits and number of layers increases. As seen from the circuit above, the overall depth is $3 + n_l * (2 * n_q + 3)$, where $n_l, n_q$ refers to the number of layers and number of qubits respectively. Thus, the overall depth would increase linearly in both number of qubits and number of layers. What this also means is that the depth is quite easy to control, and extremely viable for the NISQ era. In this particular proof of example, we show that even when the number of layers is 1 (the smallest it can be) and the number of qubits is a small number, we still get pretty good results. \n"

    "In this notebook, we have given the proof of concept that QLSTM can be used to great effect for stock price prediction, offering comparable results than its classical counterpart, while needed much fewer parameters to train and getting more information per epoch. All in all, this shows that this technique has a lot of potential in the financial world and more, as anything time series related can be trained using an LSTM and hence also a QLSTM. This is relevant not only to stock price predictions, but also for example company sales predictions or other key performance predictions. However, there are still many areas for improvement."
